    summary: Suggest missing citations
    description: >
      Given a set of bibcodes, this endpoint uses a "friends of friends" analysis
      to suggest up to 10 missing citations. These missing citations cite
      and/or are cited by the papers in the given list, but are not in the list.
      The score given with each returned paper reflects how many papers in the input
      list the result is associated with.
