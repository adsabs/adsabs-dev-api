          External resource type to return (case-insensitive). The available link types
          for a given bibcode can be discovered by returning all available resources
          for a bibcode (via `/resolver/{bibcode}`) and looking at the `type` keywords.

          Note: for `link_type` of `arXiv` or `doi`, an additional parameter, the `id`
          is required. The syntax is `/resolver/{bibcode}/{link_type}:{id}`.


          For example:


          `/resolver/2010ApJ...713L.103B/doi:10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L103`


          `/resolver/2018arXiv180303598K/arXiv:1803.03598`

      **Note**: This endpoint requires a request body, or payload,
      consisting of an array of the bibcodes to be deleted. However,
      OpenAPI v3.0.3 does not allow endpoints with the DELETE method to have
      request bodies defined; this is resolved in OpenAPI v.3.1+, which is
      not yet available.
