      For a user-supplied search string, return a list of publication titles
      and their accompanying bibstems, if the search string matches one of the
      title's official name, translated or transliterated names, or a known

      are treated as substring terminators, such that the returned result of

      and `Astrophysical Journal`.

      may also originate from other sources for individual papers, such as
      author-supplied (e.g. ArXiv) preprints and OCR by NASA ADS.
