    description: >
      For a user-supplied search string, return a list of publication titles
      and their accompanying bibstems, if the search string matches one of the
      title's official name, translated or transliterated names, or a known
      alternate title or abbreviation.  Spaces ("%20" in URL-encoded format)
      are treated as substring terminators, such that the returned result of
      a search for `Astro%20Jour` would include both `Astronomical Journal`
      and `Astrophysical Journal`.

      at a quick glance what esources are available, including publisher pdf
      and html, eprints, and ADS-hosted PDF fulltext.

      volume for which references exist.  For a publication with references
      supplied by the publisher for most or all papers, the `publisher` count
      should approximately match the paper count for that volume.  References
      may also originate from other sources for individual papers, such as
      author-supplied (e.g. ArXiv) preprints and OCR by NASA ADS.
