Guidelines for translating bash `curl` statements into Python can be found in the [converting curl to python notebook](Converting_curl_to_python.ipynb). If you prefer, you can use the unofficial Python package instead; see the top-level [README](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/blob/master/README.md) for more information."
