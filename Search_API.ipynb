    "The base URL (denoted as {base_url} in the examples below) for queries is `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search`. \n",

    "* All examples use the default HTTP method GET, unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "* the API examples in this notebook generally assume you're using `curl` statements from the shell command line--you'll see `%%bash` at the top of a cell if its contents should be run in the shell instead of in Python. Guidelines for translating bash `curl` statements into Python can be found in the [converting curl to python notebook](Converting_curl_to_python.ipynb). If you prefer, you can use the unofficial Python package instead; see the top-level [README](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/blob/master/README.md) for more information."

    "- `hl.snippets` - number of highlighted snippets to return; the maximum is 4\n",
    "- `hl.fragsize` - length of snippet to return; the maximum length is 100 characters. The snippet positioning is optimized to break on word and sentence boundaries, so the highlighted term will not always be centered in the snippet\n",
    "- `hl.maxAnalyzedChars` - this parameter is only needed if the highlighted field is very long and the frequency of the search term is low. By default, the first 51,200 characters of a field are used for highlights. If the search is returning fewer snippets than expected, try increasing this value to capture more of the field.
