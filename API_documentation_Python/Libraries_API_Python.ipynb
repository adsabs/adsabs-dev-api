Examples here will be shown using Python with the use of the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library, though the same work could be done using the [unofficial Python ADS library](https://ads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or curl commands on the command line (see the \"API documentation - UNIX shell\" folder in this same repository).\n",
